3. **Open `index.html` in a Web Browser**:
   You can open the `index.html` file directly in your preferred web browser to start using the application.

## Additional Information

The project comprises the following key files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the web application's interface.
- **style.css**: Contains the styling rules to enhance the visual appearance of the application.
- **script.js**: Implements the core functionality, including adding, viewing, and deleting tasks.

This project is primarily built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the following composition:

- **JavaScript**: 75.7%
- **HTML**: 17.2%
- **CSS**: 7.1%

## Assumptions

During the development process, the following assumptions were made:

- Users will interact with the application on a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) with JavaScript enabled.
- No backend storage is required; tasks will persist only during the session.
- The application is designed for single-user usage and does not support multiple user accounts or authentication.
- The task list is displayed in a simple, minimalistic UI without advanced sorting or filtering options.
- The project does not include a database; tasks are managed using JavaScript arrays and stored in memory.
- Users are expected to manually save their task lists if needed, as no persistence mechanism is implemented.
